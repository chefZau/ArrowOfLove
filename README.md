A Java program for pathfinding using Depth First Search (DFS). Implement a stack data type for the DFS algorithm. Here is the flow of the program:

1. Read in the filename of an input file from the command line.
2. Parse the input file into a map using the ``JFrame`` library, display it on a new window.
3. Each map will have a starting cell (node). The program will start from the cell and look for the target.
